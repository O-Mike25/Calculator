Hello My Friend.

This is a simple calculator that can help you to make basic Calculation.

I used javascript to create the different viewable component of the calculator and mathjs library to process the operations entered by the user.

You should be connected to the net to permit the mathjs library to be loaded , otherwise the calculator won't work 

THANK YOU.
